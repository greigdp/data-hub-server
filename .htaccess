# General Apache options
AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Sinatra
# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow
# 
# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one
#
# Example:
#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]
RewriteEngine On

# If your Sinatra application is accessed via an Alias directive,
# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]
